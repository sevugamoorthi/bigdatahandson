# ðŸ’Š Drug Classification using Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on **predicting the type of drug prescribed to a patient based on their medical attributes**.  
Using **Decision Tree Classifier**, the model analyzes features such as **age, sex, blood pressure (BP), cholesterol levels, and sodium-to-potassium ratio** to classify which drug is most suitable for a patient.  

### Why this project is important?
- Helps in **personalized medicine** by suggesting the right drug for patients.  
- Reduces the chance of **wrong prescriptions** and improves treatment effectiveness.  
- Demonstrates the application of **machine learning in healthcare** for decision support systems.  

### Dataset
