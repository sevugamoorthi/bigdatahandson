# üè° Boston House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Overview
This project predicts the **median value of owner-occupied houses in the Boston area** based on various socio-economic and housing features.  
By applying **regression techniques**, the model learns the relationship between input features (like crime rate, number of rooms, property tax rate) and house prices, allowing accurate price predictions for new data.  

### Why this project is important?
- Useful for **real estate companies** to estimate property prices.  
- Helps **buyers and sellers** understand the fair market value of houses.  
- Demonstrates the power of **machine learning regression models** in solving real-world problems.  

### Techniques Used
- **Decision Tree Regressor** (scikit-learn)  
- Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, normalization, feature scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand feature impact  
- Model Training, Evaluation (R¬≤ Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE)
