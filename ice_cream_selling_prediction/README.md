# üç¶ Ice Cream Sales Prediction using Polynomial Regression

## üìå Overview
This project predicts **ice cream sales** based on the **temperature** using a **Polynomial Regression model**.  
While simple **Linear Regression** assumes a straight-line relationship, real-world data often shows **non-linear patterns** ‚Äî for example, ice cream sales increase with temperature but may level off or drop after a certain point.  
By applying **Polynomial Features with Linear Regression**, the model captures this non-linear trend and makes more accurate predictions.  

### Why this project is important?
- Helps **ice cream vendors** estimate demand based on weather conditions.  
- Useful for **inventory management** and **supply chain planning** in the food industry.  
- Demonstrates the application of **Polynomial Regression** to real-world business problems.  

### Techniques Used
- **Polynomial Features** (from scikit-learn)  
- **Linear Regression Model** for curve fitting  
- Data Visualization (temperature vs. sales curve)  
- Model Training & Evaluation (R¬≤ Score, RMSE, MAE)
