# üêü Fish Species Prediction using Machine Learning

## üìå Overview
This project aims to **predict the species of a fish** based on its physical measurements such as length, weight, height, and width.  
Using **classification algorithms**, the model learns patterns in fish characteristics and assigns the correct species label (e.g., Bream, Roach, Pike, Smelt, etc.).  

### Why this project is important?
- Helps in **fisheries and aquaculture management** by automating species identification.  
- Assists **researchers and biologists** in studying biodiversity and population tracking.  
- Demonstrates a practical application of **machine learning classification models** in biology and environmental science.  

### Techniques Used
- **Decision Tree / Random Forest / Support Vector Machine (SVM)** (scikit-learn)  
- Data Preprocessing (feature encoding, scaling)  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (visualizing fish feature distributions)  
- Model Training, Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)
