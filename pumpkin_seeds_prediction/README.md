# ðŸŽƒ Pumpkin Seeds Classification using Random Forest Classifier

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project aims to **classify pumpkin seeds** into different categories based on their **morphological and geometric features**.  
Using the **Random Forest Classifier**, an ensemble learning method, the model learns from features such as **area, perimeter, compactness, length, width, and asymmetry coefficient** to accurately distinguish between seed types.  

### Why this project is important?
- Useful in **agriculture and food industry** for automating seed quality assessment.  
- Helps **farmers and researchers** in crop improvement and seed selection.  
- Demonstrates the effectiveness of **ensemble learning (Random Forest)** for robust classification.  

### Techniques Used
- **Random Forest Classifier** (scikit-learn)  
- Data Preprocessing (feature scaling, handling imbalances)  
- Model Training & Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)  
- Feature Importance Analysis (to identify the most influential seed characteristics)
