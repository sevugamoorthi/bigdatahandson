# ‚úâÔ∏è Letter Recognition using Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

## üìå Overview
This project focuses on **recognizing capital letters (A-Z)** from their pixel-based feature representations using a **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)**.  
Each letter is represented by **16 numerical features** derived from pixel values, and the SVC model learns to classify these features into one of the 26 classes (letters A-Z).  

### Why this project is important?
- Useful in **optical character recognition (OCR)** systems.  
- Helps automate **document digitization** and **handwriting recognition** tasks.  
- Demonstrates the application of **SVM/SVC algorithms** for multi-class classification problems.  

### Techniques Used
- **Support Vector Classifier (SVC)** from scikit-learn  
- Data Preprocessing (normalization / scaling of features)  
- Model Training & Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)  
- Hyperparameter tuning (kernel selection, C parameter, gamma)
