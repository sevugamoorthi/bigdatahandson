# ðŸ”® Glass Type Prediction using KNN Classifier

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project predicts the **type of glass** based on its chemical composition using the **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**.  
The dataset contains measurements of various oxide components such as **Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ba, Fe**, which are used to classify glass into different categories like building windows, vehicle windows, containers, and more.  

### Why this project is important?
- Useful in **forensic science** for identifying glass fragments in crime investigations.  
- Helps in **material science** for categorizing and analyzing glass manufacturing processes.  
- Demonstrates the application of **KNN â€” a simple yet powerful ML algorithm** â€” in real-world classification tasks.  

### Techniques Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier** (scikit-learn)  
- Data Preprocessing (feature scaling, normalization)  
- Model Training & Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)  
- Hyperparameter tuning (**choosing optimal K value**)
