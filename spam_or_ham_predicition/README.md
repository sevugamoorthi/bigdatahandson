# ðŸ’¼ Salary Prediction using Experience (Regression Model)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on **predicting the salary of an employee based on years of experience**.  
Using regression techniques, the model learns the relationship between **experience (independent variable)** and **salary (dependent variable)**, and predicts salaries for new data points.  

### Why this project is important?
- Helps **HR departments and recruiters** estimate fair compensation for candidates.  
- Useful for **employees** to understand expected salary growth with experience.  
- Serves as a beginner-friendly example of applying **machine learning regression** to real-world data.  

### Techniques Used
- **Linear Regression** (scikit-learn)  
- Data Preprocessing (cleaning, splitting into train & test sets)  
- Model Training & Evaluation (RÂ² Score, MAE, MSE, RMSE)  
- Data Visualization (experience vs. salary trend line)
