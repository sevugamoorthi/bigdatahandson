# ðŸ“§ Spam or Ham Prediction using Naive Bayes and NLTK

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project classifies emails/messages as **Spam (unwanted)** or **Ham (legitimate)** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.  
By applying text preprocessing and the **Naive Bayes classifier**, the model learns patterns in word usage and determines whether a message is spam or not.  

### Why this project is important?
- Helps in **email filtering systems** to automatically block spam messages.  
- Reduces risks of **phishing and scams** by detecting suspicious content.  
- Demonstrates the application of **NLP + Machine Learning** in real-world cybersecurity.  

### Techniques Used
- **Naive Bayes Classifier** (MultinomialNB from scikit-learn)  
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** for text preprocessing  
  - Tokenization  
  - Stopword removal  
  - Stemming/Lemmatization  
- Feature extraction with **Bag of Words (BoW)** or **TF-IDF**  
- Model Training & Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix)
